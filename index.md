This article covers the sentiment analysis of any topic by parsing the tweets fetched from Twitter using apache fume.Sentiment Analysis is the process of ‘computationally’ determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It’s also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker.In this project ,main concentration points are Retweet_Count and Screen_Name.

The proposed method is made by considering following scenario under consideration An Airport has huge amount of data related to number of flights, data and time of arrival and dispatch, flight routes, No. of airports operating in each country, list of active airlines in each country. The problem they faced till now it’s, they have ability to analyze limited data from databases. The Proposed model intension is to develop a model for the airline data to provide platform for new analytics based on the following queries. kindly click on [AirlinesAnalysis](https://rkrahul04.github.io/AirlinesAnalysis/)

Analysis of structured data has seen tremendous success in the past. However, analysis of large scale unstructured data in the form of video format remains a challenging area. YouTube, a Google company, has over a billion users and generate billions of views. Since YouTube data is getting created in a very huge amount and with an equally great speed, there is a huge demand to store, process and carefully study this large amount of data to make it usable The main objective of this project is to demonstrate by using Hadoop concepts, how data generated from YouTube can be mined and utilized to make targeted, real time and informed decision.For more info, click on [Youtube-sDataAnalytics](https://rkrahul04.github.io/Youtube-sDataAnalytics-/)
